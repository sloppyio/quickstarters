# Flow Director

Flow Director is a new generation messaging platform that combines any 
cloud- and on-premise messaging products, databases and REST services with 
the simplicity of flow-based programming.

## Enabling additional Protocols

You can enable the following additional protocols by setting their ports from -1 to the port number in the json file:

- AMQP: 5672
- JMS: 4001
- MQTT: 1883
- ROUTING: 4100

Flow Director has an embedded protocol multiplexer and you can access all protocols
through the single public port (443 for TLS) on the Internet.


## Start it

```
sloppy start -var=URI:mydomain.sloppy.zone flowdirector.json

Example:

sloppy start -var=URI:fd4711.sloppy.zone flowdirector.json
```

When the container is started, you can navigate with your browser to the URI which you specified on deployment.

On the dashboard press START, select System app and login with user admin, password changeme. This is the default password after installation.
